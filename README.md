Using the Package called as pytubefix

-> A input box to take the url for downloading either a video or audio  

#Captions are a bit of tricky to handle that
i got in a loop that i have to add that to the file or just give another input to
take that yt_video and download it seperately.
will look and try to find a seperate way.
